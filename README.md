## _About_
My game's concept was to be a rogue-like akin to "Slay the Spire" with Map-Based Traversal, but with Turn-Based RPG combat and mechanics.

**Some of the Game's Features:**
1. Shard-based Spell System
2. Party Recruitment
3. Enemy-types (Monsters, Elites, Bosses)
4. Areas/Rooms (Combat and Towns)
5. Randomly Generated Map

_Intended for learning purposes only._
